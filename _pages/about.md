My name is Aleksandar Stefanov. I am an IT professional with more than 15 years of experience. During that time, I gained hands-on know-how in architecting and deploying solutions for different organizations' sizes across many industries and sectors. 

With my strong technical skills and excellent interpersonal skills, I can develop and coordinate cloud architecture between IT and business operations, translate the business requirements into technical solutions, and help clients in their successful cloud journey. With my professional background, I can also lead and take an active part in technical implementations. In a team environment, I am both a natural team leader and a productive team member.

I hold B.Sc in Computer Science, Azure Solutions Architect Expert, and Azure DevOps Solutions certifications from Microsoft and Professional Cloud Architect certification from Google.

Currently, I work as a Cloud Architect at TomTom. Opinions on this site are my own.
