Nevertheless, hi, my name is Aleksandar Stefanov. I am an IT professional with more than 15 years of experience, born and raised in Macedonia. After I graduated from the university, back in 2004, I started working as a systems engineer and teaching assistant at the faculty I was studying in the previous four years. I started my master's studies in parallel, but after finishing the first year, I realized that the academic environment is not for me. Early 2006, I joined a company named Infinite Solutions, where I stayed for almost 14 years. In the last several years at Infinite Solutions, I figure out that the cloud is the future, and I focused my development and my work towards Azure. 
To gain experience working on bigger enterprise projects, I looked for opportunities abroad and landed in The Netherlands. Here I worked first at Devoteam, one of the leading IT consulting companies in Europe. Today I am an Azure Solutions Architect at the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) at TomTom.

Opinions on this site are my own, not connected to the work I am doing at TomTom.
