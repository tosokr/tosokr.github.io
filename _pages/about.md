My name is Aleksandar Stefanov. I am a technology expert with more than 15 yearsâ€™ experience in the IT industry. During that time, I gained hands-on experience in architecting and deploying solutions for different sizes of organizations across many industries and sectors. 

With my strong technical skills as well as excellent interpersonal skills, I can develop and coordinate cloud architecture between IT and business operations, translate the business requirements into technical solutions and help clients in their successful cloud journey. I also have tremendous hands-on experience, and I can lead and take an active part in technical implementations. In a team environment, I am both a natural team leader and a productive team member.

I hold B.Sc in Computer Science, Azure Solutions Architect Expert, and Azure DevOps Solutions certifications from Microsoft and Professional Cloud Architect certification from Google.

Currently, I work as a Senior Consultant / Cloud Solutions Architect at Devoteam Netherlands. Opinions on this site are my own.
